# RGB-LED

## About
This is basically my attempt at making an RGB LED. I hope that I will get at least one red, green, nad blue LED,(If not I have a few), and I wat to try to turn on each LED witha  button, so that I can change the combination of the LEDs on, so tha I can make any color, and I also added a potentiameter, for the intensity for overall brightness, however I would add a poteniameter for each LEDm so that you can make any color. 
## BOM
- LED 1 Red, 1 Blue, and 1 green
- 3 220 Ohm resistors
- 1 PCB
- 3 push buttons
- 1 potentiameter
